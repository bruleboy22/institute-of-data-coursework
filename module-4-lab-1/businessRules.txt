B.dub Business Rules and Layout:

B.dub is short for "Black and White" (B&W), which represents the overall concept of the entire site. 
The platform is designed to start in black and white, but as the user engages more with the site, 
it gradually becomes more colorful.

Page 1: Simplistic Login/Sign Up Page
- The page features a black background with white text.
- The B.dub logo is prominently displayed at the center of the page.
- The "Sign Up" button is located at the top left corner.
- The "Log In" button is positioned at the top right corner.
- The copyright information is placed at the footer of the page.

Page 2: Black and White User Info and "Gray Zone" Home Page
- This page maintains a black background with white text.
- If a user chooses to sign up, they are directed to a user info page where they are asked about their interests 
(e.g., sports, movies, music, etc.). The interest imagery is also presented in black and white, with white borders
separating them from the black background.
- If a user logs in, they are taken to their "Gray Zone," which serves as their home page. During the sign-up 
process, the user would have already expressed their special interests. Consequently, these interests will now 
start to appear in color on their "Gray Zone" home page.
- The "Gray Zone" home page also provides suggestions for friends. The friend's imagery remains in 
black and white until both parties agree to form a mutual friendship. Once mutual consent is reached, their 
respective imagery starts to unfold in color. Until a mutual agreement is established, the relationship 
is considered to be in the "Gray Zone."
- The level of interaction with the site determines the colorfulness of the user's "Gray Zone." 
As the user becomes more engaged and interactive, their "Gray Zone" becomes more colorful.
